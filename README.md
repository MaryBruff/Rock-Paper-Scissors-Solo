## 🔧 Installation Instructions:
- Fork this repository here (my repo) https://github.com/MaryBruff/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Solo
- Clone down your new, forked repo
- CD into the repository
- Open it in your text editor
- View the project in the browser by running open index.html in your terminal


## 📚 Learning Goals:
1. Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
2. Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
3. Use your problem-solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself not to rely on an outside "answer" to a logical challenge
  

## 🥇 Wins:
* Creating a fun theme that I could bring to life through my HTML and CSS.
* Accomplishing all the app features outlined on the project page was my most significant achievement!
* Asking for help when debugging and checking my logic toward the end of the project! I can get stubborn when it comes to getting help, but I was at a point where I needed another set of eyes. I learned that sometimes getting help can simply be having fresh eyes read your code and seeing things you might be missing. 

## 🚧 Challenges:
* Deconstructing complex tasks into more manageable segments has been a persistent challenge for me. Because I was repeating, all my other projects felt much more straightforward this time. Even though I still made my list of iterations, it could have been more detailed. No matter the application, having a thorough plan is better than having a minimal strategy. 

* Creating functionality just for the Data Model first and then the DOM. If I had separated my files for just the Data Model and Dom, this might have been easier to do, but having them both in the same file made it challenging to do one thing or the other.
